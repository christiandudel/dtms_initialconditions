# Variance-covariance matrix of initial proportions and transition probabilities in a discrete-time multistate model

## Description

This repository contains code to simulate the variance-covariance matrix of 
initial proportions and transition probabilities in a discrete-time multistate 
model. Currently, the code implements two different data-generating 
processes (DGPs): a fully Markovian DGP and a non-Markovian DGP with
duration dependence. The results show that the covariance between the
initial proportions and the transition probabilities is negligible.
